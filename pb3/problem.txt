Let G = (V, E) be a connected graph with n vertices and m edges. Let c : E → {c1, c2} be a cost function on its edges (c1 < c2). Let Gi = (V, Ei) a spanning graph of G with Ei = {uv ∈ E : c(uv) = ci}, for i ∈ {1, 2}. Denote by pi the number of connected components of Gi.
(a) Prove that the minimum cost of a spanning tree in G is [c1(n − p1) + c2(p1 − 1)].
(b) Devise an efficient algorithm for finding a minimum cost spanning tree in G.
